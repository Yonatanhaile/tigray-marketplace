## 📋 Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 18
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router v6
- React Query (TanStack)
- Socket.io Client
- React Hook Form
- React Hot Toast
- Axios

### Backend
- Node.js 18
- Express
- Socket.io Server
- Mongoose (MongoDB)
- Bull (Redis queue)
- JWT
- bcrypt
- Nodemailer
- Winston (logging)

### Worker
- Puppeteer
- Bull queue processor
- Cloudinary/AWS SDK

### Infrastructure
- MongoDB Atlas (Database)
- Redis (Queue & Cache)
- Cloudinary (Media)
- Vercel (Frontend hosting)
- Render (Backend + Worker hosting)

## 🔑 Important Notes

### Payment Disclaimer (Implemented Everywhere)
The platform does NOT process payments. All payment flows are "intent-to-buy" with offline completion. Disclaimers are shown:
- On listing detail pages
- In intent modals
- During registration
- In footer (TOS snippet)

### OTP in Development
OTP is logged to server console in development mode (`OTP_DEV_MODE=true`). To use Twilio or other SMS services, replace the `sendSMS` function in `server/src/services/otp.js`.

### File Uploads
- Default: Cloudinary
- Alternative: S3 with CloudFront
- Toggle via `USE_S3` environment variable
- Both implementations included

### Socket.io Scaling
Redis adapter code is included but commented out in `server/src/server.js`. Uncomment to enable horizontal scaling across multiple server instances.

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

Target: >70% coverage achieved

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- Mobile-responsive design
- Real-time updates via Socket.io
- Toast notifications
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Payment method icons
- Safety guidelines modal
- Intent confirmation modal with disclaimers

## 🔒 Security Measures

1. **Authentication**: JWT with 1-hour expiration
2. **Rate Limiting**: 
   - Auth endpoints: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
   - OTP endpoints: 3 attempts per minute
3. **Input Validation**: express-validator on all endpoints
4. **Sanitization**: express-mongo-sanitize
5. **File Validation**: Type and size checks
6. **CORS**: Configured for frontend origin only
7. **Headers**: Helmet.js security headers

## 📈 Scalability

The application is designed to scale:
- **Horizontal**: Redis adapter ready for multiple backend instances
- **Database**: MongoDB with indexed queries
- **Queue**: Bull for async job processing
- **CDN**: Cloudinary/CloudFront for media
- **Caching**: React Query on frontend

## 🐛 Known Limitations (Development Mode)

1. **OTP**: Logged to console instead of SMS (replace with Twilio for production)
2. **Email**: Uses SMTP test service (replace with SendGrid/Mailgun for production)
3. **Free Tier Sleep**: Render free tier services sleep after inactivity
4. **MongoDB Atlas**: Free tier has 512MB storage limit

## 📝 Naming Convention

All code follows consistent naming:
- **Files**: camelCase for JS, PascalCase for React components
- **Variables**: camelCase
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- **Routes**: kebab-case
- **Database**: camelCase with ObjectId references

## 🎯 Why Vite Over Create React App?

**Vite was chosen because:**
- ⚡ Faster dev server (instant HMR)
- 📦 Smaller production bundles
- 🔧 Better plugin ecosystem
- 🚀 Modern tooling (ES modules, esbuild)
- 📈 Future-proof (active development)
